<h2>🎭 About The Persona: <a href="https://github.com/CMIYC-Spidy"><b>CMIYC Spidy</b> </h2>

My journey into cybersecurity began with a fascination for the 'Black Hat' world—the challenge, the anonymity, and the high-stakes game of **CMIYC** (Catch Me If You Can). While I have chosen the path of a defensive professional, I don't hide that this 'Black Hat' curiosity was my original driving force. It is what sparked my interest in how systems work and how they are broken.

Today, I use that same 'Attacker Mindset' to build better defenses. **Spidy** represents the internet as an intricate web of protocols and architecture, signifying my deep dive into the digital ecosystem. 

I keep the persona **CMIYC Spidy** as a reminder of where I started and as a promise to never lose that raw curiosity that drives me to push my limits in this field.
